**scripts, code and data for the paper "Exploring the inverse line-source scattering problem in dielectric cylinders with deep neural networks"**
(published in )

This study presents a novel approach utilizing **deep neural networks to
address the inverse line-source scattering problem in dielectric cylinders**. By employing
Multi-layer Perceptron models, we intend to identify the number, positions, and
strengths of hidden internal sources. This is performed by using single-frequency
phased data, from limited measurements of real electric and real magnetic surface fields.
Training data are generated by solving corresponding direct problems, using an exact
solution representation. Through extended numerical experiments, we demonstrate
the efficiency of our approach, including scenarios involving noise, reduced sample
sizes, and fewer measurements. Additionally, we examine the empirical scaling laws
governing model performance and conduct a local analysis to explore how our neural
networks handle the inherent ill-posedness of the considered inverse problems. 

**1. Classification problem**
We solve the first inverse problem, that is classifying the number of
unknown sources N = 1 or N = 2, from the knowledge of surface electric and magnetic
fields. File classification_2sources_final.py,  includes the corresponding python code. 

**2. Inverse problem with one source**
We solve the inverse source problem to predict the position and strength
of a single line source inside the dielectric cylinder. This problem is faced as a multioutput
regression problem, to predict all parameters of interest with the same model.
File regression_1source_final.py,  includes the corresponding python code. 

**3. Inverse problem with two sources and fixed strength**
The inverse problem of predicting the positions of two line sources having fixed strength
File regression_2sourcesFix_final.py,  includes the corresponding python code. 

**4. Inverse problem with two sources and variable strength**
The inverse problem of predicting the positions together with the strengths of two line sources.
File regression_2sourcesVary_final.py,  includes the corresponding python code.
